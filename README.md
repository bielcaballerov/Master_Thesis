# Master Thesis: NER/RE Strategies for Biological Graph Completion

This repository contains the code and resources for my masterâ€™s thesis, focused on Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) strategies for biological graph completion.

## Contents

- **`NER.ipynb`**: Implements the rule-based model for Named Entity Recognition. This notebook contains the code for extracting entities using specific predefined rules and processes.
  
- **`benchmark_tfm.ipynb`**: Prepares the benchmark datasets and evaluations required for the thesis project. This notebook handles data processing, formatting, and various performance benchmarks.

## Pretrained Models

Due to the large storage capacity required for pretrained models, all files related to models used in this project are hosted externally. You can download them from the following link:

## Repository Overview

This repository is organized into notebooks, data files, and scripts that facilitate the extraction of biological entities and relationships from PubMed abstracts. These resources are part of the thesis titled "NER/RE Strategies for Biological Graph Completion."

## Requirements

To run the notebooks and scripts, make sure to install the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
